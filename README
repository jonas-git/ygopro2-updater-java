Terminology and syntax:
  - "api" stands for the official GitHub API (api.github.com).
  - "raw" stands for the server that delivers raw GitHub repository content (raw.githubusercontent.com).
  - Variables are either prefixed with a colon (':') (in URLs) or surrounded with triangle brackets ('<>').
  - URL paths are sorrounded with braces ('{}') for the "api" and with brackets ('[]') for "raw".

HTTP headers required (*) (or recommended) for some requests (which are specified in the parantheses):
   (  api  ) "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
 * (api/raw) "Authorization: Token <token>"


Initial download (when no log file exists yet):
  - get the tree of the master branch with {/repos/:owner/:repo/git/trees/master?recursive=1}
  - visit step A
  - create the file updatelog.json and add the sha and all file paths

Update of previous downloads (when there is a log file):
  - get the tree with the updated files by comparing the sha of the lastly downloaded branch
        to the most recent one (master): {/repos/:owner/:repo/compare/:sha...master}
  - remove deleted files from the local file system and the list in updatelog.json
  - redownload files from the list that are missing locally [/:owner/:repo/:sha/:path]
  - download the rest of the files that were added or modified (with step A)
  - set the sha in updatelog.json to the sha of the last commit listed in the api response
  - add the files that were newly added to the repository to the list in updatelog.json

step A - download:
- download all matching files in the tree into their corresponding folders from [/:owner/:repo/:sha/:path]
  -> matching files are files that match the pattern in updateconfig.json (field 'source')
  -> corresponding folders are the target download folders named in updateconfig.json (field 'destination')


updateconfig.json: {
	"repositories:" [
		{
			"owner": <owner>,
			"name": <repo>,
			"files": [
				{
					"source": <wildcarded-path>,
					"destination": <folder-path>,
					"update": <boolean> // either update or always overwrite files
				},
				// ...
			]
		},
		// ...
	]
}

updatelog.json: {
	// sha of the branch that was updated the last time:
	"sha": 80a42df2f5174266b04a3d49f19694b3591e4057,
	"files": [ /* list of all file names that were downloaded... */ ]
}


Considerable options:
  - let the program download the newest release of itself
  - keep and ignore locally modified files
